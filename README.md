# 🎬 MovieLens Recommender System 🍿

Welcome to the **MovieLens Recommender System**! This project is your ticket to exploring movie recommendations using the power of PySpark. Get ready to dive into a blockbuster adventure of data and code!

## 🚀 Getting Started, Results, and Conclusion

### 🎥 Steps to Follow:

1. **Load Data** 🍿
   - Import the necessary libraries and load the MovieLens dataset. Lights, camera, action!
   - Read the ratings data from `ratings.csv` and drop any duplicate entries. Clean data, happy data!

2. **Data Preprocessing** 🎬
   - Load and preprocess the movie metadata from `movies_metadata.csv`. Let's get this show on the road!
   - Ensure we have a clean and usable dataset. No messy scripts here!

3. **Build the Recommendation Model** 🎞️
   - Split the ratings data into training and test sets. Like a true director, we need to plan our shots!
   - Build and train an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model using the training data. This model is our star performer!

4. **Evaluate the Model** 🏆
   - Evaluate the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Let's see if our star shines bright!
   - Measure the accuracy of our predictions. Are we hitting the box office or the bargain bin?

5. **Recommend Movies for a User** 🍿
   - Create a function to get the top movie recommendation for a specific user based on the trained ALS model. Tailored just for you!
   - The function will return the movie with the highest predicted rating for the user. Drumroll, please...

6. **Find Top N Similar Movies** 🎬
   - Implement clustering to find similar movies based on their genres and other features. It's like a genre-bending crossover!
   - Use K-means clustering to group movies into clusters and find movies similar to a given title. Movie magic at its best!

7. **Results** 🎬
   We'll showcase the results of our recommendations and clustering, including the top recommended movie for a specific user and examples of similar movies within the same cluster. It's a movie marathon!

8. **Conclusion** 🍿
   This project demonstrates the power of PySpark in building a scalable movie recommendation system. By leveraging collaborative filtering and clustering techniques, we can provide personalized movie recommendations and discover similar movies based on user preferences.

Lights, camera, code! 🎥

Happy recommending! 🍿
